    "Since you have distance and region data, the \"mystery\" of your freight value is solved. These are much more direct physical drivers for your model.However, your finding about Freight Value and Product Weight is actually more interesting now. If distance is known, but weight is weak and freight is strong, it implies the company is being charged based on Volume (Size) or Fixed Carrier Fees, rather than just how heavy the item is.Here is how you should structure your regression and further analysis:1. The Regression Variable StrategyYou should definitely include Distance, Region, and Freight Value.Distance: This is your \"Physical Baseline.\" It explains how long it should take to drive there.Region: This captures \"Infrastructure Noise.\" Some regions might have better highways or more efficient local hubs.Freight Value: Keep this! Since it has a stronger correlation than weight, it acts as a proxy for Service Level. It tells the model: \"Is this a premium shipment or a budget shipment?\"2. Distance vs. The \"Sunday Wall\"This is where you can find your most powerful \"Root Cause\" evidence. You need to see if distance matters less than the day of the week.The Analysis: Compare a 100km delivery ordered on Monday vs. a 100km delivery ordered on Sunday.The Interpretation: If they both take roughly the same time, then distance is the ruler. But if the Sunday 100km delivery takes 12 days longer than the Monday one, you have mathematical proof that the bottleneck is \"Process-based\" (the weekend), not \"Distance-based.\"3. Dealing with the 73 RegionsSimilar to your product categories, 73 regions is a lot for a regression model.Action: Check the Mean Delivery Time per Region.Grouping: If you see clusters, group them into \"High-Efficiency Regions\" and \"Low-Efficiency Regions.\" This simplifies your model and makes your final report much easier for a human to read.4. The \"Weight vs. Freight\" ParadoxSince you found a weak correlation for weight but a strong one for freight, you should calculate Freight per KM.$$Freight\\_Efficiency = \\frac{Freight\\_Value}{Distance}$$The Finding: If some regions have a much higher \"Freight per KM\" but the same \"Delivery Time,\" the business is overpaying for shipping in those areas without getting faster results. This is a huge \"Value Add\" for your project—you're not just finding delays; you're finding wasted money."
